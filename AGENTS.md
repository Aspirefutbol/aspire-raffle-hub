# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Raffle Hub — project notes for agents

- Read `docs/architecture.md` first; `docs/Raffle-Hub-Developer-Blueprint.pdf` is the product spec.
- Authorization is enforced in Postgres (RLS + `has_org_permission`) **and** in server actions (`orgAction` in `lib/actions.ts`). Keep both when adding features.
- Multi-record writes go in Postgres functions (`supabase/migrations/*`), called via `rpc()`; supabase-js has no client transactions.
- Audit events are written by DB triggers. Don't write `audit_events` from app code.
- Never hard-delete roster or fundraising rows; archive (`archived_at`).
- The app never uses the service-role key. Only `scripts/seed-dev.mjs` does.
- Schema change → new migration → `npx supabase db reset` → `npm run db:types` → `npx supabase test db`.
- Phase 1 deliberately has no tickets, sales, payments or checkout (Texas CREA offline-payment model).
